# About AI News Aggregator

This project was created to provide a centralized, automated way to stay up-to-date with the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence.

## How It Works

1. **Content Sourcing**: Our system automatically scans multiple RSS feeds and websites
2. **AI Relevance Filtering**: Articles are filtered using keyword matching to ensure they're AI-related
3. **Content Processing**: Each article is saved as a structured MDX file with metadata
4. **Site Generation**: VitePress builds a fast, searchable static site
5. **Automated Deployment**: GitHub Actions keeps everything updated

## Data Sources

We aggregate content from trusted sources including:

- Tech industry publications (TechCrunch, The Verge, Wired)
- Official company blogs (OpenAI, Google AI, Microsoft AI)  
- Research institutions and academic publications
- Cloud provider AI blogs (AWS, Azure)
- AI-focused news sites and analyst blogs

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: TypeScript with Bun runtime
- **Frontend**: VitePress (Vue.js based static site generator)
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- **Content**: MDX files with frontmatter metadata
